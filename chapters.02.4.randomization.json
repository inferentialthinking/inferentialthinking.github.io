One of the reasons\nwas that the older children could go to work and thus help support the family.\nSantiago Levy, a minister in Mexican Ministry of Finance, set out to\ninvestigate whether welfare programs could be used to increase school enrollment\nand improve health conditions. He conducted an RCT on a set of villages,\nselecting some of them at random to receive a new welfare program called\nPROGRESA. The program gave money to poor families if their children went to\nschool regularly and the family used preventive health care. More money was\ngiven if the children were in secondary school than in primary school, to\ncompensate for the children’s lost wages, and more money was given for girls\nattending school than for boys. The remaining villages did not get this\ntreatment, and formed the control group. Because of the randomization, there\nwere no confounding factors and it was possible to establish that PROGRESA\nincreased school enrollment. For boys, the enrollment increased from 73% in the\ncontrol group to 77% in the PROGRESA group. For girls, the increase was even\ngreater, from 67% in the control group to almost 75% in the PROGRESA group. Due\nto the success of this experiment, the Mexican government supported the program\nunder the new name OPORTUNIDADES, as an investment in a healthy and well\neducated population.","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":1},"end":{"line":22,"column":1}},"key":"el6kNas6y0"}],"key":"ACS7ROJRGW"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":43,"column":1},"end":{"line":43,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"strong","position":{"start":{"line":43,"column":1},"end":{"line":43,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Benefits of Randomization","position":{"start":{"line":43,"column":1},"end":{"line":43,"column":1}},"key":"HasM6VBZij"}],"key":"c8YZ0n8zp6"}],"key":"z0r4qowivw"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":45,"column":1},"end":{"line":49,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In the terminology that we have developed, John Snow conducted an\nobservational study, not a randomized experiment.
