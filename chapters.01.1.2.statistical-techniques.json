Although these\ntechniques have often been reserved for advanced courses in statistics, their\nflexibility and simplicity are a natural fit for data science applications.","position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":1},"end":{"line":19,"column":1}},"key":"kFqDPCkuQr"}],"key":"PcUtP8pmnQ"}],"key":"qNfp8aBBNf"}],"key":"zLATmnbr8q"},"references":{"cite":{"order":[],"data":{}}},"footer":{"navigation":{"prev":{"title":"Computational Tools","url":"/chapters/01/1/1/computational-tools","group":"Computational and Inferential Thinking"},"next":{"title":"Why Data Science?","url":"/chapters/01/2/why-data-science","group":"Computational and Inferential Thinking"}}},"domain":"http://localhost:3000"}
