    "Sometimes we are interested in a categorical attribute of our sampled individuals. For example, we might be looking at whether a coin lands Heads or Tails. Or we might be interested in the political parties of randomly selected voters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such cases, we frequently need the proportions of sampled voters in the different categories. If we have the entire sample, we can calculate these proportions. The function `sample_proportions` in the `datascience` library does that work for us. It is tailored for sampling at random with replacement from a categorical distribution and returns the proportions of sampled elements in each category.\n",

    "- the sample size\n",
    "- the distribution of the categories in the population, as a list or array of proportions that add up to 1\n",
    "\n",
    "It returns an array containing the distribution of the categories in a random sample of the given size taken from the population. That's an array consisting of the sample proportions in all the different categories, in the same order in which they appeared in the population distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose each plant of a species is red-flowering with chance 25%, pink-flowering with chance 50%, and white-flowering with chance 25%, regardless of the flower colors of all other plants. You can use `sample_proportions` to see the proportions of the different colors among 300 plants of the species."
