Exploration involves\nidentifying patterns in information.  Prediction involves using information\nwe know to make informed guesses about values we wish we knew.  Inference\ninvolves quantifying our degree of certainty: will the patterns that we found in our data also appear in new observations? How accurate are our predictions? Our primary\ntools for exploration are visualizations and descriptive statistics, for\nprediction are machine learning and optimization, and for inference are\nstatistical tests and models.","position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1},"end":{"line":4,"column":1}},"key":"pb7fqWQUKr"}],"key":"EhP712BxxK"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":13,"column":1},"end":{"line":21,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Statistics is a central component of data science because statistics\nstudies how to make robust conclusions based on incomplete information.
