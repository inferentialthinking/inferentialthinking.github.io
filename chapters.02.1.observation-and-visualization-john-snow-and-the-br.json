To get your mind into\nthe right timeframe, try to imagine London in the 1850’s. It was the world’s\nwealthiest city but many of its people were desperately poor. Charles Dickens,\nthen at the height of his fame, was writing about their plight. Disease was rife\nin the poorer parts of the city, and cholera was among the most feared. It was\nnot yet known that germs cause disease; the leading theory was that “miasmas”\nwere the main culprit. Miasmas manifested themselves as bad smells, and were\nthought to be invisible poisonous particles arising out of decaying matter.\nParts of London did smell very bad, especially in hot weather. To protect\nthemselves against infection, those who could afford to held sweet-smelling\nthings to their noses.","position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1},"end":{"line":4,"column":1}},"key":"I1n9H1dXxN"}],"key":"eJE02b9bSD"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":1},"end":{"line":25,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"For several years, a doctor by the name of John Snow had been following the\ndevastating waves of cholera that hit England from time to time.

Snow was skeptical of the miasma\ntheory. He had noticed that while entire households were wiped out by cholera,\nthe people in neighboring houses sometimes remained completely unaffected.
